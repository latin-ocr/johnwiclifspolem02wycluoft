GR UOIATA. 587

rant Ι V, 28. — The copyist of Β is not happy in his independent
readinys; in one case only, he has a correct one in distinction to ’
the rest, in 59 instances, as I have said above, a wrony one. Thouylz
therefore his text is preferable to E’s, he cannot enter the competition
either with A—-C, or D-G,

I have not arrived at a certain conclusion concerniny the merits
of O aud A. But in consideration of the fact that the hand in G which
wrote the Cruciata is comparatively the best of the Vienna series (in
the 26 Tracts of these volumes Ο has in 13 instances formed the basis
of thet ατί), and that Ο in only 15 cases out of 355 yives a wrony
reading] ayainst the consensus of the others (A 19, B 57), I am in-
olima to accord it the preference.

The following) diayram is the result:
