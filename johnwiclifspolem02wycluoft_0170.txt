540 INTRODUCTION TO JOHN WIOLIF’S

we find written authority for it? p. 550. If from the temporal Lords, .
they have (1) no riyht to expose their subjeots to the dartqers of a ’
Journey and of soreiyn lands, when (2) theyleannot even protect them- · sp
selves ayainst assaults from without and within, p. 551. If, then, the ’,ἲ
riyht of Citation proeeed neither from Christ, nor from the temporal ,

Lords, then it eomes from Satan. On the other hand, when taking .,

on oneself sueh duties, not soree, but voluntary love must prevail. -J ¹
The C'itations however are nothing] but a foreible means of emtortinq -' .

money, p. 551.

Chap. III. The Citations are not only unfounded in Scripture,   1
but are most injurious, (1) because the pilyrims ‘to Rome only see
what is bad, p. 552,· (2) because the travellers are left without wiri- 7 ὲ
tual eare, p. 552. Eoery one who favours the C'itations, be he a ’ ²

Chureh prelate, or temporat prinee, only furthers a work of Antichrist,

p. 553. Forward then, Soldiers of Christ, remember the vow you have ’
made to Jesus Christ, forward, take up the strife ayainst this Anti— ’

Woe to the land, which submits to his supremaoy, p. 553—554.

Chap. IV. Enquiry into the three canonieal yrounds of eoeouse, ³³ - .
necessary obstaeles, illness, command of the Kiny, p. 554—555. W.

lays claim to these for himself, p. 556.

Chap. V. Notwithstandiny the protensions to superiority over 2 γι
the temporat Lords, even over the Emperor, which contrary to Scripture s ἵ
are raised by the Pope — himself a powerless fuyitive --, the pious „ ¹

Christian is unable to obey, p. 556-558,

Chap. VI. -If the obJ'eotion be raised, (1) that the Pope is the =

Ghureh as Peter onee was, it is to be said: —— only in so far, as

like Peter he holds the riyht saith, p. 558, and does not hypomitieally ⁴ ’

pretend to false power ete„ p. 559. The true head of the threh is

Christ. The Ghureh without Pope is not therefore without head, but ’
is rather freed from the oppressive burden of worldly possessions, f .,

p. 559.

Chap. V II. If it be objected (2) that throuyh her spiritual power γ’

Rome restrains many from sin and erime, this may be admitted in a 5 ff
certain sense, p. 559. But with God the question is not '‘what', but · .
