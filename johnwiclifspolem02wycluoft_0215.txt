OB UOIATA. 5 g 5

Ε must have had another source. Ε is not A’s oriyinal, cp. ad
hoe fing. etc. IV, 10, 11, dicit ibid. VII, 38, sciant etc. X, 51.

E'3 here sets in to supply E’s omissions,· the scribe of A could, there-
fore, only have had as his oriqinal the teoet of Ε after its having]
been corrected by E3, which I do not consider probable.

E's corrections aISO, (such at least as come into consideration)
mnot be traced to A, but rather to B, or some codex closely con-
nected with B (cp. below p. 644), cp. ecclesie VIII, 69, adult. VIII,
55 ,· popul. VII, 48, auderent ΙΙΙ, 61, especially corrob. IV, 28,
which appears to me conclusive,· omnia IV, 3,· eius ΙΙΙ, 8,· per II,
112, est ista Π, 115 (position),· vexion. II, 75,· sepe IX, 15, nese.
IX, 47,· lex V, 4,· nisi X, 67 and especially non—enim IV, 8,· Ε3
in all these passayes has followed the readinys of Β, or of some codea·
of an earlier date standiny in close connection with it.

Conclusion. A and Ε have oriyinated from the same archetype,
but not from each other. E3 sprung] from B, not from the yroup
GDG (cp. e. i. populum VII, 48, eius ΙΙΙ, 8, sepe IX, 15 etc.,
cp. also the readinqs of B—E'3 just mentioned).

(2) Group G—D—G. That these belony to one class is evident
(1) from the yreat conformity of their readinyS, which in itself possess
considerable value and are independent of the rest as compared with
A—E, Β,· Ι take a chapter ad libitum as an eccample, cap. IV: studios.

VIH, 3,· they read the same in 54 passayes which differ from the
consensus of the rest,· — (2) from a yreat number of words which
according to the sense belonq to each other, but whose order is in itself
quite irrelevant, cp. fore. sit ΙΙ, 18, spir. suff. v. p. V, 63,· i. gr. e.
VI, 65, g. i. X, 84 and many more, which I will make no further
mention of in this place,· in all these instances, O—-D——G hold to
“ one version, A—-E, B to another. —- Therefore C-—D—G' and A—E',B
, must have sprung] from different archetypes.

A nearer connection between either of these three codices cannot
be tlzouqht of, as their dissimilarity is in some passayes very marked.
But D—G‘ stand in closer connection to each other than to Ο, they have
. probably had their oriyin from the same source, cp. the monstrous form
in dedissemionibus Ι, 26 (cp. the remaniny readinys) and in corrob-
oration of this supposition illegit. II, 73,· intell. IV, 4, conting. V,
