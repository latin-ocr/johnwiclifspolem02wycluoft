DE RELIGIONE PRIVATA I. 487

dedly consider not to be yenuine. After Shirley Lecliler, J. v. W. ΙΙ,
568, who does not undertake the critical eacamination of the question.
Vauyhan is silent about the Tract.

But the testimony of the Vienna and Prayue codd. is also insuf-
flo-ient. Cod. G contains no notice of its oriyin from W. The old
indes) on tlte flyleaf of the cod. β (cp. above General Introduction I V,
Description of the Manuscripts) yives the title of the Tract amony
other writinys which do not owe their oriyin to W.. but still it has
a notice referring to the author: Idem, that is J. W„ whose yenuine
Practs precede it. This is the only early, and indirect authority for
its qenuineness.

Cod. A also contains the Tract in its indesc, on the front cover,
sub No. 26 and with the separate title: Argumenta contra posicio-
nem de religionibus privatis (cp. the Description of tlie cod. above

”in the General Introduction, IV). But in spite of tlte General Title
of the Index: Liber Wiglef doctoris Ewangeliei not all tlte Tracts
named here are by W. himself (cp. Nc. 19 Compilacio metrica de
Replieacionibus) and under the very No. 25-27 all those Tracts
which are not W's, seem to be put toqetlter: No. 25: Posieio disei-
puli Magistri Iohannis de Eucharistia, No. 26: Argumenta etc. see
above, No. 27: Solueiones quarundam questionum. Therefore, tlte indens
of the cod. does not in any way prove that they owe their oriyin to W.

The same is the case with cod. α. In the indea: on the front cover,
the title of the Tract is placed amony W.⁷s writinys2· but ltere also
De Rel. privata is followed by Raeiones cuiusdam discipuli Wikleph
quibus probat ficere etc. etc. The last Tract in the indeoe de Imagi-
nibus is also very doubtful as to its oriyin from W„ cp. Shirley,
Catal. Nc. 26².

Prom this follows, that the eoeternal evidence is of the least

. possible value in proof of authenticity. God. α and A seem rather

to point to this T ract as beiny by one of W's discipleS.
The internal evidence is also very weak. A yreat number

of turns in the expression remind one of W.’s style; tlte lenythy
construction of the sentences struck me most, cp. p. 501—2;

505—6,· 508 and many more. On the other hand, the following]
reasons seem rather to point ayainst its being) compiled by W„-
