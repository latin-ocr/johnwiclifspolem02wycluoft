observe the larye nwmber of readinys peculiar to Ε which I cannot
particularize here for want of space. — As to their oriyin, I have
ὲ, not been able to ascertain whether both Manuscripts were copied
directly from the same sowrce (which to me does not appear probable),
or whether their oriyinal lies stac farther back.
, Class D—ffl. Both codices were copied far less carelessly than either
E or F. Among] the 535 passayes (the readinys of F and F¹ are in-
cluded in this number), D and β yive the same readiny in about 400 v
- instances; in 21 cases they yive the same reading] ayainst the ayree—
ment of the rest: 366 sibi (om.) Ι, 10,· preco I, 4o,· optima ΙΙ, 36 ,·

B. The best Codeoe. F with 163 (431s30s0) and Ε with 152
” (3 7⁶70) false readinys amony the 383 decisive passayes, must be at once
.. excluded from the competition for the first place. As F yives in no
. case independently of the rest a correct reading] (sinerent III, 16, being]
“ an orthoyraphical form), and often contains a continuous series of
1, corruptions, ΕΙ being? also worthless with the eoeception of numinis
II, 27 (three of his numerous corrections are incorrect) , I will not
, qive in my critical list the variants neither of F, nor of ΕΙ with the
. eoeception of the above few mentioned. On the other hand, the scribe
