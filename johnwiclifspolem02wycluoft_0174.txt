VI'I. The Manuseripts. ·
A. Their relationship. I. χΤΙῑθ yroup A—E. The ayree- .

ment in this· yroup is, it is true, in no way remarkable. In the 215 μ ⁷

paesaqee which differ, A—E' ayree on the whole 59 times; both 'alone

ayainst the ayreement of the rest, 20 times, These numbers , there- f

fore, are not weiyhty as proof of their relationship. Ε, here as elsa.
where, has been eopied very earelessly,· it often yoes its own false ways,
and thus the number ofpassayes in which ayreement of the two i-s· found,

is limited. The readinys usitab. Ι, 48, domini I, 55,· domini IV, 12,· ”

the other,· Ε is not a eopy of A: ep. hoc ete. Ι, 9,· mu. Crist. I,43; η

Nor was A a eopy of Ε.· ep. cit. et ΙΙ, 21, also tali V, 2. -—- ²· “
We have to deduce their relationship from an oriyinal whieh is older ’ ⁴

than A—E.
To this unknown oriyinal most likely the maryinal ylosses be-

lonqed, both of A and Ε (important for the derivation and relation· ¹>

skip of both). From the oriyinal they have passed throuyk various

hands (A1A2‚E1) to aa two copies, as bom, wia aa exception of ³
Intencio ete. VII, 16 which belony-s· to a new hand (A3 or A4), pre- j ¹

sent all these maryinal notes. I have in vain endeavoured to discover ’
a eonneetion between the eorreetors and the seribes of the teaet. De· ,

ser. ete. ΙΙΙ, 22 and et si. III, 4, also cit. ete. ΙΙ, 21 appear to me to '-
eaeelude the supposition that A had eopied from Ε after this had been =

eorreeted. Neither did the oriyinal of E'2 belony to the series of ma- ᾗ·

nuseripts here used.

II. Group G—-oc, Both eodd. are in elose connection ; of 215 · ·
vassayes which differ, both ayree 1 70 times ,³ α ayrees with A , which = ν
stands nearest to G (ep. culpa hoc exig. I, 9,· laniandum I V, 13; ’ 1
deut. VI ete. IV, 1.9; iniunxerat V, 17), aeeordiny to my oountiny
only 121 times. Aqainst G, a ayrees with the rest only 25 times. ² 1·
