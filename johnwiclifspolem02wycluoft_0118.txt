488 INTRODUOTION To JOHN WIOLIF’S

   
    

(1) the tone whieh so essentially differs from ‘that of the other work&

printed in this volume, and the dry seholastie style of arquatum?
(2) the frequent referenee the the yreat Fathers of the Ghureh, St. Greyor,
Auyustin, Hieronymus, whilst the Bible is hardly onee refero· ed to as Ἰ
a witness which is oonstantly the ease in the other yenuine ειηὲἰωερε· ’-
of the Doctor Ewangelieus; (3) the abstraet aryumentation ayainst &a ’
religio privata, whioh is nowhere to be found in W.'s yennine works, ⁴
where in every ease the sinyle representatives of this vita are attaoked
from a praetieal point ‘of view. The polemieal aryumentation also, ⁴
solely directed ayainst the monachi, is remarkable. While in other ὰ ”
works the quatuor secte novelle are oonstantly mentioned, here they
are not even onee spoken of, and it is just these whioh are the favou- ·
rite objeots of W.'s wrath, when speakiny of the matter here attached. γ’
(4) Lastly the sacerdotes simplices are spoken of here in contradistinot ·
tion from the Prelates and Bishops (as ‘subordinates'), but not εἰει s ,
the speeiffio Wielifian sense, as opposed to the four Seots. This may* ἕ· “
suffice to eharaeterize the Traet. Althouyh I am not prepared to eon· ²-
sider any of the foreyoiny reasons as ineontrovertible, I still hesitate td*
reooynise the pamphlet as a yenuine work of W! 8. ·
