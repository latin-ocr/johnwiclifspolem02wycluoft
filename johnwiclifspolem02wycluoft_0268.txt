been eleeted on the 20‘h September 137 8,] and sled from Urban’s ho-
stilities to Aviynon after Easter 13 793* Another reference, ep. p. 683.-
Papa fugit latenter ut latro de loeo in locum ete.“’' seems to point
to this sliyht. — Lastly, Wielif mentions the Crusade itself μ’ 681
Ut patet de cruciata nuper derecta eontra antipapam, qui videtur
pape nostro pretenso plus humili* adversari and p. 6²82: Verisimile
est, quod illis laborantibus in illa cruciata defecerunt fides, spes
et caritas, et sio tam in corpore quam in anima sunt occisi. —- The
Ora-sade, (and that the allusion is to the Gru-sade itself, not to the -
preparatione* for it, the seeond passaye plainly shows) beyan in May
1383.⁵ Bishop Spenser of Norwieh embarked for Flanders in the
middle of May 1383, bnt after a shortlived success in the war, was .
compelled to return to Enyland soon after Michaelinasfi' The end of ⁷
1383 or the beyinninq of 1384 may, therefore, be fiaeed upon with =
tolerable certainty as the date of composition.

IV. Genuineness.

Upon this matter there ean hardly be the shadow of a doubt,· Δ
both internal and externat evidence witness to the authorship of ’

Internal evidence: the style, ideas and mode of reasoniny ,-
are thronyhont the sanie as in the undoubtedly yenuine works of
Wz‘olifi· indeed so far does this correspondenee extend, that particular ³
trains of thought in other of Wielif⁷s works are here verbally repro· .

4 This accounts for the still very moderate ''lanyaaye of W'wlif' against
Urbem. The passage is of importance for this last stage of the confliet.
