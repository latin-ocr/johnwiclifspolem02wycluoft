404 JOHN WIc'JLIR DE MENDACJJS FRATR UMss

account we ean hardly be wrony in placiny this small Traet about
the year 1382.

Of its authenticity there ean also scarcely be a doubt: all the
Wieh‘f cataloyues irc Vienna include it; further ep. the old Indices
in eod. A und J und Denis, God. MS. ΙΙ, 1444,· 1450; 1455, as well
as Shirley, Cat. No. 88 p. 28, and Lechler, J. v. W. ΙΙ, 568. -

ψ With reqard to the MSS„ I add that a cursory compari-son of
the various readinys (note 3,· 4,· 6,· 8,· 9,· 10,· 13, 14,· 15‚·416’),' as
well as the Title and Eoeplieit, prove the relationshe‘p between J—K
and A-- Ο. v

J and K are probably derived one from the other. They hcwe ’ ’
been fauttity copied (note 6,· 8,· 10,· 14), therefore A or G, which atre
of equal value, may be taken as a basis of the teoet.
