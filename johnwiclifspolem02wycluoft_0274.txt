the apparatus criticus the readinys of E, where they 669666 606616 Α,
and of those which differ from A, only the principal, 80 far as they
seemed of importance in helpiny the reader to form an opinion as to A
the value of the codex. But in proportion to the worthlessness *of E
itself, is the value of its Corrector, ΕΖ, who corrects E's teaet not only
conscientiously, but also from a 90061 copy. The emendation is not J ’
taken from A itself, (ep. consistit sanitas I, 12 ,· fideli III, 5,· totaliter ³
ΙΙΙ, 6,· quod III, 22,· racionis IV, 28,· patenter VI, 34,· fuisse VI, 43; J
infundabiliter XIV, 40 and many more), althouyh this would not have
been an impossibility per se. — Karl Malle-1 considers ΕΙ 60 have
corrected from Β, because the former ‘out of 30 variations (there are
in fact 33) coincides 27 times with B, even in variations of 6666666669] ‚
That this hypothesis is untenable, 8666668 60 6666 60 be clearly shown by
two of the very readinys 960666 above, namely by patens VI, 34 ; tota- ,
liter ΙΙΙ, 6,· and further by coex. IV, 8,· patet XI, 22, where the 606·- “
66666066 960666 by El 68 6606 found in Β at all. The 6666616669 J oh. XII, -
14, 60166616 under other circumstances rniyht perhaps also be used as s
evidence 6696666686 Β, 68 of no importance, because additions of this kind j
may be made at pleasure. I arn more inclined, after another careful
comparis-on, to place ΕΙ 666 dependence on the yroup G—D,· in 28
cases out of 33, E coincides with G—l) (patens, totaliter are 960666 by Ι
C-D), the only eoeceptions are peccav. VII, 23 ,· domino XI, 3,· quo-
modo XI, 28,· undiquamque XI, 46, which do not yreatly affect 6166 ἡ
question, then coex. IV, 8, and especially patet XI, 22. 1111610666 has V
this last, contrary 60 6166 common (and false) consensus of all the other
MSS. ,· E1's 0669666661 616666 68 perhaps to be found in the archetype of j
G—D, which had patet (and coex.). In any 66686, neither patens nor
totaliter can be explained on the theory of his dependence on Β. - ’
Ι 9606 6166 corrections of E ² below in the lectio varia, as his ooiyirml =
appears to have been none of the codd. here used. E'2, E3 and E* are
three other hands, they 9606 660 varyiny 6606666698, but only maryinal notes. ‚

II. The class G—D. Before I proceed to consider the question,

in what relation the two MSS. stand to one another, I will describe
them separately 666 their individual peculiarities.
