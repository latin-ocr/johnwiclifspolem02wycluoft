DE CHRISPO ET SUO ADVERSARIO ANTIOHRISTO. 645

1. The single Codices,
(A) Codeoe 0. — (a) The teat of 0 has been submitted to two

’ correctors, C² and 0². Wherever the readinq seerned uncertain, 0 left

a space free for later insertion, copied therefore with forethouyht and
consideration, and is thus comparatively valuable: in these blanks I V, 5 ,-
VI, 263· IX, 27,· XII, 8 01 has supplied what was missing), in a
firm hand, and after a qood copy: to the thin flourishiny hand, G2
belony three or four insiynifieant maryinal note-5. C3 is an indepen-
dent qlosser. -— ( b) The Mar-ommia: 0 has the following) mar-
qinal notes: 4⁰¹r seete 11, 3 (0); Quid est clerus cesarius Quid
Monaehi‚ Canonici Fratres ΙΙ, 1 (03 - witten above ool. 1250ι in the

Ι upper m-aryin),· Supposicio 11, 19,· 'Silvester penituit VH, 16 (03-

half blotted out above col. 128a),· Protestaeio magistri VH, 29 (0),·

- vellet suam iurisdieeionem XIV, 6 (0 —- this is not a yloss, but simply

a eatehword of the copyist for the beyinniny ,of the new folium 133a).²

(B) Godeoe D. -— (a) D is far less valuable than 0. That its tran-
seription was inaeeurate and thouyhtless is evident frorn a yreat num-
ber of varying] readinys; I will only instance a few: veritas 1, 24,-
elerus ces. II, 4,· sentencie ΙΙ, 18,· puro HJ, 162· enim iungeret V, 30,-

γ foret VI, 263· relucebat (om.) VI, 32 and many more. — (b) The

Marqinalia: a number of maryinal ylosseS, all differinq from the
qlosses of G, are peculiar to D. It is remarkable that they only be-

. beyin with the theoloyieal part (from eap. V onward).

(2) 0-1) are of the saone family. That the two are closely
related may be clearly proved: but the material before me does not
suffice to determine the question of their haviny sprung) from one
another, as in the ease of A— E. Ι imayine that both codd. have
sprunq from the same (unknown ²) source. In proof of the near re-

, , lationship of the two codd„ I would appeal in the first plaee to the

eopious and eonsistent consensus of the variants of C—D, when

¹ In this place, I would remark once for all, that Ι do not introduce the
marginal numbers, letters, hands, finqers, NB. NB. and other signs in my critical
list of readinqs‚ because they do not appear to me to contribute further to the cha-
racteristic of the different MSS. but rather to render the survey more difficult.

2 At any rate, neither A, B, nor δ is the original.
