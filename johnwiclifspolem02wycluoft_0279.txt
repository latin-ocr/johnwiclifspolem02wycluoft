DE CHRISTO ET svo AD VERSARIO ANTJOHRJSTO. 649

B. The best Codeoe. Leehler, in his review of my edition
of De Christo ete.,² and K. Milller irc the critique already mentioned,
decide for Β as the most valuable eod„ and as beiny therefore best
suited for forminy the base of the teoet.

Leehler still has at hand some extraets from eod. 3933 from
his former labours on Wielif so that he was irc a position to eoea-
mine more elo-sely some 'of my readinyS. I am yrateful to him for
calli-ny my attention to instruencium Ι, 11 (he mentions also uter for
utrum p. 684 l. 2), to which he appeals in proof of the yoodness of Β.
Duo-inq my Christmas holidays in 1881, I onee more eoea'mined the
eodd.² and I certainly found instruentium irc Β, but instrumentum irc
‘ the others. Instruentium for instrueneium is a departure from the
orthoyraphy obtaininy throuyhout the entire Godeee, whioh strihes me
fas very remarkable, and whieh betrayed me into my first readiny..
At the same time, however williny I may be to suppose, that the t
may be owiny to B’s oriqircal, which may have had instrumentum, it
is instruentium which is here, ared I must consider this readirly, not
only as justified, but as preferable to the reading] instrumentum. —
But the ease is different with uter, whteh L. has misread: the teat

, has utrum. This yives quite a qood meaniny, since the indireet que-

stion is to be applied to the Pope as such, ayaihst whom the whole
treatise is directed.

The readinys brouyht forward by Milller to establish the supe-
riority of Β over the other MSS. lihewise appear to me incombusive?
He mentions 3 readihys as showirty the sztperiortty of Β.· finaliter Ι, 16,·
habilitate VII, 6² and supponitur X, 34. Williny as orte may be to
admit the betterness of, at least, the two first readinyS, they do root

prove anythiny for the valae of Β beyond what they prove also for Ο

tive vacue. Of all the 240 passages, δ has about 110 readinys in common with
class A—E', with B 102, with Ο 98 and with D 91.

2 Unfortwnately Mit'ller's very ewefal review appeared in print in a yreatly
elam-temti form, which does not in the least show whether there is any foundation
for his objection to my application of* the MSS. In a letter to me, Prof. Milller
hae kbmlly supplied the deficiencies of the print.
