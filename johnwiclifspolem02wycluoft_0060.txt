430 J. WIC'LIF‚ DE DUOBUS GENERIBUS HAERETIOORUM.

the old index on the cover of eod. Ε) is in favour of this. See
further:

(1) the Vienna Wielif CataloyueS, ep. above p. 7

(2) Denis, Oool. MS. Theol. II, 1443

(3) Shirley, Catal. p. 30 No. 96².

The frayment is probably an eoetraet froin one of W.'s sermons;
the whole tone indicate-s· this (tota communitas eto. p. 432; Sed heu!
ad tantum eto. p. 432,· Amen at the end) ; it is, perhaps, a part of
the Opus Ewangel. (De Sermone Domini in monte) IV. part, De
Anticristo, ancl seerns to be taken from the 14⁸²² chapter (God. Trin. ’
Coll. Cambr. B. 16. 2. fol. 353—432 and G. 123. fol. 3—332).
Shirley , Gatal. 58 and 65 yives the Incipit and the Explicit (he reads
the latter incorrectly) .· Duo sunt genera hereticorum . . . . Eoepl.
observanoiam (p. 65: observaneia) faciendo. Compare also Arnold,
S. E. W. III, 211, 216. The frayment is so far not without impor-
tanee, as on the one hanel it treatS, ancl that with some asperity, of
the universal corruption of the priesthood (not the Mendieant fflriars)
and on the other, the whole tone eoepresses sorrowful resiynation at
the corruption of the Ghuroh. At the beyinniny the pamphlet eoin-
eides with the oriyinal Enylish Traet; after the duo genera have been
briefly described the two frayments differ, as is often the ease with W„
in the tenor of their aryurnents and the tone of their polemios , op„

for instance, De Officio Pastorali published by Leohler, L'eipsie 1863, ‚³
and Mathew, Ε. W. h. u. p. 405 ff. ⁷

IV. Still unpublished.
V· Emistiny only in eod. 1337 = E fol. 1810—18101.

VI. The frayment is in the eodem without corrections or mar-
yinal notes. The handwritiny differs sornewhat from that of the

pamphlets preceding} it in the Manuseript. The Traet whieh follows:
De Trinitate beyins in a new hand.
