542 INTRODUOTION TO JOHN WIOLIF’S .

passaye can here refer — occured in the year 1383. This ayrees

well with the allusion to Hereford's irnprisonment p. 554, op. Lechler‚ ⁴ . 3

J. v. W. I, 685 ff. and the personat reference, which is to be found in
the Tract at the end of chap. IV. During) the last two years of his
lise, W. was paralyzed,² so that takiny into consideration the above
notice, we arrive at the end of 1383 or the beyinniny of 1384. —-
The latter notice is important, because it mentions as a fact that W.
towards the close of his life was cited to Rome by Urban ,· that the‘
citation may, therefore, be reyarded ‘as an historical fact.“ ²

¹ This notice we owe to Thomas Gascoiyne‚ who, in 1441 , heard it from a

certain John Horn, a man of 80 years and for a time emate of Jolm Wiclif‘ · J

himself.- et iste Wycleff fuit paralyticus per duos annos ante mortem suam, cp.
Lewis, Hist„ ed. 1820, 336. ’

2 Leemer 1,712 ff. doubts this, beiny inclined to ae opinion that it rests χ ⁴
merely on W's so-called Letter of Excnse to Urban (aeeorcbmy to Fonte, Acts· aad Ἄ

Mon„ ed. 1844, ΙΙΙ, 49, Lewis, Hist.(1829)122ff.; Vasuyhan, Isife and Q. I, 121,-
J. d. W„ a mon. 320 ᾖ.) It msast be admitted, that, like so many others, the

Letter of' Excase is no letter, bat perhaps an extract from a sermon. But thie fact 3

alone does not αφρεακν to me (1) to tell against the existence of the citatim, ep..-
Et si in persona propria ad votum potero laborare, vellem praesentiam Romani
pontificis humiliter visitare. Sed Deus necessitavit me ad contrarium et eonse-

quenter me docuit plus Deo quam hominibus obedire, Leehler‚ J, v. Ψ. Γ χλ

ΙΙ, 634. And (2) it is mmistakeabzy prove-'d hy the words: et sic dicit quidam

debilis et claudus citatus ad hano curiam, below cap. IV p. 556, that the αἱ· . J

tation really took· place. The reasons also, why W. did not 90, are in both fray-
ments the smne.- quod prohibicio regia impedit ipsum ire, quia rex regum neees-
sitat et wlt efficaciter, quod non vadat. -—
