ficum romoenomem Schismate, with the Incipit: Ob inauditas lites inter
hos dum,- From a mere glance at these two Incipit-s· it is clear that
theg are Bale’s Latin translations 07⁴² the connnencement *of the corre-
sponding English Praei.- For pis nncouffie disoeno-ioan fiat is bitwiaee fies
“popes semeffi to signyfie pe perillous tgme fiat Ponl seiffi schalde come in
fies laste dages, cp. T. Arnold, S. Ε. W III, 5249. In Arnold's volume&
the title of the (English) Tract corresponds to tkz‘sjs De Pontificum
<romanoram schimate. Shirley’s wpposition, cp. Catal. p. 94, that
the Pract De Papa (quoted bg Walden, Doctrinale fidei, II c. 49. III,
Prol. IV 39, 45 ) ie identical with Bale's is not correct,· for W
wrote, indeed, a Pract with this title ; Matthew has printed it, E. W.
h. a. (Nro. XXVIII) p. 458—482. Likewise Arnold's opinion S. E.
W. III, 242 ) that the Latin Vienna Tract De Dis-censione Paparum‚
printed below, is not identical with his English one, the Latin tract being
nncch &horter than the English version, is not correct. Comparing both
Praete we perceive at once that both are past-allel versione. The Vienna
Tract which I print below is merely a fragment of the english one,
being the first chapter of the whole worlc (which had 8 chapters).
This ie evident from the marginal gloss in Ο at the clos-ing of the Tract:
non est hic finis, quia deberent esse 8 capitula. The two catalogues
of the Wiclificma in the Vienna codices 4514, fol. 1052 ff. and 3933,
fol. 195 ascribe, indeed, eight chapter-s· to the present Tract with the
Incipit as given below and the Explicit: est in clericis iam perversis.
which in thie form in both Indices is given. From these few words it
is difficult to decide whether the English version printed by Arnoch
which likewise contaims eight chapters is the Same as the work· of the
two catalogues. I have not been so fortunate as to discover the whole
Latin pao-allel version in any of the Vienna MSS.‚· I believe, however,
that in the English Tract the whole matter os* W’s original work· is
given. — A short Summam of Centenis is given by Vanghan‚ Traeis
amd Treat.‚ p. 64—65. A-s· to the inner relation of the Latin to the
anbiaeh version, cp. below note f* ¹² cp. I Tim. 4, 1—-2,· II Tim. 3,
