522 INTRODUOTION TO JOHN WIOLIF’S

Chap. III. As a reason for the necessity of private religion-s
some assert, (1) that they serve God in a nobler manner, and are,
therefore, more perfect, than the ordinary members of Christ, p. 531.
For (a) it is said, that the consilia are their rute, p. 531 ,· (b) that
Christ with his 12 disciples was a member of them, p. 531 ’ and
(c) that there is no specifiedifference between the several sinyle Orders,
p. 531. -— All this is wrony,· for as to the first, its members are

entanyled in wordly affairs, therefore their service is false, p. 531— ² ’

532,· as to (b) .· Christ has founded only the yenerat reliyion, as His,
words clearly show, p. 533. As to (e).· there are differe-noes in the'

very principles: rich and poor orders, secular and ,monastical cler-oy ρ 3

etc„ p. 533.

Chap. VI. In the second place it is asserted that for members j '

of the Order it is easier to be saved. —— Answer: by busqiny the cano-
nisation nobody will be saved, p. 534. Thirdly it is said, that the
obstacles to beiny saved are more easily removed within the Orders. — ’

Answer: if this be true, then the founders of the Orders were more , ”

prudent than Christ the Lord Himsetf, p. 534-5-5‘5. Gut and colowr

of the habit, eatinq, drinhiny, caps and other worldly peculiarities of j- ,ξ
the Order (breediny of swine etc.) are of no advasntaye for eternal life, 3

p. 535.

From all these reasons the theses of the dominus are to be rw
diated, p. 536.

III. Date of composition.

The Tract is without any chronoloyical evidence. Once thore ie ,ς-
α hint at the Pope as refuga p. 535 l. 8,· qu this term, either Urban V1.,- ·

who sled to Naples 1383 from Rome, cp. Ypod. Neust. 338, or 01οὲ- , ἑ

ment VII. is meant, who in 1379 took refuye in France before the*
followers os Urban, op. Watsz‘nqh„ H. A. Ι, 393. From me whole
tone of the Traet, Ι am inclined to fia: it in the last two or three?
years of W.'s life. ’
