CR UCJATA. 581

untenable, p. 606. The authority of the Scriptures witnesses ayainst
the leaders of the war and their supporters; pious priests who with-
draw themselves from the struqyle must be permitted to preaeh undistur-
f bed, p. 606-607,· the Pope before all others is quilty of apostasy for
ineitinq to war, instead of followinq Christ in all humility, p. 608.

Chap. VI. As thus the Pope rejects Christ, so Christianity and,
more espeoially, the seeular Lords should reject him, p. 609. Christ
suffered in all meelcness, but did not set men ayainst each other and
exhaust the land,· the Pope tells a diabolieal lie ,' when he says that
he is Christ’s representative and is empowered to promise salvation
to all who fiyht in his-cause, p. 610-612,

Chap. VII. Second objection: The Pope having been lawfully
chosen has a riqht to offer sueh a reward, p. 612. - Answer: Neither
the cardinal-5⁵, nor any other man has any riyht to ehoose a head for
the Chureh contrary to God’s will ( tots east for MatthiaS, Aets I), but
„ still less a Pope who plaees the lives of his followers in jeopardy for
the furtheranee of his own private and worldly desiyns, p. 613. In
shavp contr-ast to him behold Christ who told Peter to sheath his sword,
who rode unpretentiously on a ass, forbid murder (I Tim. III), prayed
for His enemies, endeavoured to procure the peace of the people, permitted
Himself to be led as a lamb to the slauyhter, Ρ.613-615. The aetion
of the Pope's Crusade is in every respeet an opposite one to the eaeample
thus set. Α better yospel should be souyht for by the Pope for the foun-
dation of his cause, p. 615. Further personal dissimilarities between
Christ and the Pope: summe humilis — superbus 3 in iniuriis pa-
ciens —— proprie injurie vindicativus3 pauper —- summe dives; non
habene, ubi eaput reclinaret — habens eastra3 ministrativus — do-
minatissimus 3 peragravit civitates in magno labore ewangelizans ——
inclusus in castris mittit bullas, Ρ. 616--617.

Chap. VIII. Third objections The power over souls with
whieh Christ endowed His Apostles cannot yet be eoehausted, Ρ. 617. —-
Answer:⁴ This power was intended for the performanee of qood and not
of evil,· it would, moreover, be possible that those who came after the
Apostles, should on account of their sins have lost this power, whieh
eannot surely be bestowed by sardinals who are apt to fall into error
eoneerniny the fitness of person (Popess Anna) p. 617—619. It would,
therefore, be possible for the Chureh to exist without a Pope or ear-
dinals, indeed without the former it would enjoy yreater peaee,
p. 619-621. “
