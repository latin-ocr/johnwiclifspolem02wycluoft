These four readinys of Ο and D are so remarkable, that a dependenee
of Ο on D, or of D on G, miyht be maintained on the strenytli of them,
were it not for the number and importanee of the many differiny readinys
which render such a theory impossible. But however important this
consensus of 0 and D may appear, it would be eaqolained by tlte
two codd. having] a common oriyinal, or two different ones betonyiny
to the same family. The following] small selection of readinys are
specimen& of the variatione of both mentioned above: I, 6',· 9,· 19, 26,
27, 33, 34, ΙΙ, 6,· 18, 20, 22, 25,· 27 and 30 on in tlte following]
capp. — Conclusion: 0—1) both belony to the same family,
which is distinet from the class Α-Ε, but are notin imme-
Δ diate dependenoe one on the other.

(III) Cod. Β. Apart from the two yroups described under (I) and

‘ (II), B takes its own way, now in harmony, now in disayreement with

the one or the other, now with readinys peculiar to itselfil (1) B in
ayreement with yro‘ap A—E: ipsius Ι, 10,· spiritale Ι, 15, eccle-
siarum Ι, 20, exemplatur Ι, 22, dicit Ι, 23, ista ΙΙ, 32, sub-
stancie ΙΙΙ, 9, quantitativa·qualitativa IV, 4,· sit fundata IV, 11,-
est (om.) IV, 20, deitati IV, 21, angeli IV, 32, est IV, 25 and
27 eta, to which more miyht easily be added from a comparison of tlte
readinqs. (2) Β in ayreement with yroup G—D: iuvare Ι, 8,· cor-
poris consistit sanitas Ι, 12, finaliter I, 16, nec Ι, 21 ,· domini
ΙΙ, 8,· dividunt ΙΙ, 12, instinctu ΙΙ, 13,· circa ΙΙ, 15, fideli ΙΙΙ, 5,-
omnes cum etc. III, 17, nec IV, 10,· illum sensum V, 4, ponens
V, 9,· alicuius istorum V, 13,· quemcunque V, 20, multis quod
ex ete. V, 29, sic VI, 4,· necessario VI, 10, fuisse VI, 43 ete. which
like tke above miyht easily be multiplicet. (3) B’s independent
readinys: (a) lectio vera: quomodo IV, 5,· secundum IX, 13,
adversantur X, 47, declaret XIV, 13 (ep. ὃ), fugiat XV, 33.
(b) lectio falsa: et (om.) Ι, 18, regulam I, 25, observacionibus
II, 9,· laboret ΙΙ, 16, primo (om.) ΙΙ, 23, quatuor (om.) II, 26,
secta (om.) ΙΙ, 30, illis ΙΙ, 31 and many more, omitted here for want

¹ The orthoyraqoby consiiderare‚ desiiderare, hiistoriacam ete. is pecu-
lim· to B.
