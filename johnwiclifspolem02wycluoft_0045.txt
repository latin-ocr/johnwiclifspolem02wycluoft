(b) Internal evidence:
(1) The style of the Traet in a eertain deyree differs from

that of W.'s later wrjtinyS. But on the whole, I don't
think there is sufficient reason to doubt its yenuineness
on this aeoount, the more so as the lanquaye, phraseo-
loyy, mode of arywmentation is undoubtedly of the Wielif
stamp. In particular, the wliole tone of the Traet suits
well Wielis's politieal viewS, and the references to Enyland
are frequent; the Four Seets also are mentioned in their
traditional order, op. p. 421: triplicitatem sectarum,
ut monachOS, canonicos et fratreS, qui indubie sunt ad
onus pauperum regni nostri3 as fourth Seet, the clerus
cesareuS, whom the Traet attaelcS, is presupposed.

¹ As the Traet is very short, I own give only a few hints on the MSS.
