642 INTRODUOTION TO JOHN WIC'LIF'S

VI, 20, whioh belong] to the ylosser A2, Omnibus apost. ete. VI, 8,· ..
Quare secta ete. VIII, 14 ,· Quando erit ete. VIII, 28,· Regulari etc. '
IX, 28,· Petrus ete. X, IO,· Papa edific. ete. XII, 16², whieh belong] ·
to ylosser A3, lastly nadir IV, 33, which belonys to ylosser ΑΨ ’

These ylosses belonyiny to Al—A4 (—— 41 in number —) are 'to
be found with the same wordiny only in E? It is also to be obser-vad ,ᾗ
that from eap. IX the notes yrow less frequent, and that from the *¹
middle of eap. XII they oease altoyether: correspondiny in both eodd. ,⁸ ἑ3·

moreover that the ylosses of both eoineide repeatedly, even to their ss “

unusual orthoyraphy, for emample capud ecclesie* in eap. IV and >
eap. V, whilst in the teoet both codices read caput. There are five ἢ
maryinal notes at the beyinniny of the T raet (two at the end of cap. Ι ι
and three in the middle of eap. II), also a note at the end of βαρ. ΙΧ, ’,
whieh are peculiar to Ε and not to be found in A. -- On the other ἐ
hand, and this it is of importanee to point out, the maryinal qlosses ·‘
of the four other MSS. differ entirely, in position as well as in
composition, both from one another and from those of class A—E. ’ .

(e) Only A and Ε have the Ozeeh note: Mily boze ete. XII, 38, .
whieh is very characteristic, and perhaps deeisive of *the question J
in hand.

(d) Lastly, only A and Ε have the equally characteristic lacuna ς
ΙΙΙ, 17. - Eryo: the codices A and Ε are related to one ’
another. ' “

(2) A is the oriyinal of E, not viee versa, also the two ζ
eodiees cannot possibly have a common oriyinal. Proof:
(a) In a larye number of passayes the scribe of A has written in·- ,-
eorreetly , and then erased the wrony word (either by a line drawn ’
throuyh it, or dots below) and yone on eorreetly, ep„- consistit sani- “

from A3. “ ,

surely, either a very late gloss, or cm emendation, amd Papa edific. XII, 16. Α
