696 INTRODUCTION To JOHN WIGLIF’S

Chap. IV. (2) It is said that the enyaymnents entered into by

the temporal lords for fitting] out the cleryy with temporal riches, must ’ ’
uneonditionally be kept , p. 703. Refutation of this assertion, ‘2

). 703—704. ‘
1 Chap. V. The four Sects the introduction of which is spoken

of as a qood and meritorious work, p. 704, before all others take ·
upon themselves the defence of these theses, p. 704. But it must be Α ι

said that their introduction is wrong), p. 704, as the teaehsiny of ;
Christ plainly shows, p. 704. The head of the Sects endeavour to
seduce all believiny christians away from the Gospel truth, p. 705.

Chap. VI— VIII. In connection with this opposition between the » f

members of Christ and Antichrist is the assertion of a frater, that ’
the old and common division of the Militant Church into three parts
is not correct, p. 705, for women and children are not included in it, ¹

p. 707—— 708, and the cleryy must be considered as laboratores, p. 708. ·

-- Refutation by the Author of all these objections on the yround of s
reason and Hozy scripture (aaz. HL· [ΛΑΜ XL· Mala. XH;> Eph.1; ’
Rom. XIII,· Matth. XXII), p. 708-709, - Eoecursus on the relation of -‘
the Mendicant Friars to this old traditional division, on their foun- Β
dalion and the many evils, which have befallen the C'hurch in conse- ,
quence of their introduction, p. 710. From all this, it is evident,

that they are with their head superfluous and ouyht to be done away
with, p. 711—712.

III. Date of Cmnposition.

There is only an argumentum e. silentio from which the date of
the Tract may eventually be infer-red. It is curious to see that Wiclif
in the list of the heresies of the Mendicants with which the Tract winds ¹

up, does not mention the Roman doetrine of transubstantiation, which ⁸
otherwise is his main reproach ayainst them in his polemical writinys. ,

Also from the sliyht hints at an Htwlish translation of the Bible,
which may be inferred from the passayes libri ewangelici cap. VIII ι
p. 711, as well as from the persecution of the sacerdotes fideles p. 711 .
a direct and conclusive date camot be inferred. I leave therefore the
date of this present Tract uncertain. ⁴
