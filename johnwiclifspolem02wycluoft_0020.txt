390 JOHN WJOLJF, DE soL UTJONE SA ΤΑΝΑΕ.

n. 6,· 10,· 1.9,· 20,· 27,· 43 and this continues so to the end. But N

the material before us is not sufficient to prove whether E has been
copied from A, which appears to rne not improbable.

So far as I carl see, D—K are also related, cowlpare, for
example, chap. I, n. 17,· 20,· 52 etc. etc. ι

ΙΙ. As to which is the best codex, I may remark, that amonqst
the few decisivo readinys, G is by far the most frequently correct. ,

The yroup A—E, especially the careless E, is eoeceedirtyly cor-
rupted.

K is not much better, compare chap. 1, n. 57· 9,· 13,· 14 ,· 18,· ξ.
20,· 3o; 32,· 37,· 46',· 52; 54,· 57,· 61,· 62,· 66; 70,· 72; 75,·'

84 etc. etc. This may suffice.

D is unreliable, since it can be proved that it does rtot follow ’ἶ
its oriqmal closely, but has often been copied according] to' the sense,
or, at least, carelessly irc its way, compare chap. I, rt. 44 ,· 48 ,· 76,·

78,· II, 14,· 15,· 23,· 34 and 56¹.
I, therefore, yive the text accordiny to cod. G.
