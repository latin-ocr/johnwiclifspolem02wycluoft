II. Summam] of Contents.

Chap. I. Thesis: Is the institution of monastioat Orders (the

¹ religio privata) a divine, qood work? p. 524. — It is not, otherwise Christ
’ would (1) have instituted them in the Gospet, and (2) would not have

sent His diseiptes among] the nations, but would have shut them up in

÷ thewatts of a monastery, p. 524. Christ. therefore, ouyht not to be

'⁷ taken as an authority for the matter in question, neither as to the number
(— here' the 12 disoiples are compared with *the many thousands of
’ monhs), nor as to the life of the Crders, whose pernieious· traditions

are often contrary to the simple preaohiny of the Word of God,

Τρ. 525-526. It is therefore wrong] to entiee youny men into the Orders,
ᾗ ,ἴον no spiritual qraoe, moral virtue or yenuine piety is aequired by
’ the admission into them, p. 526-527.

Chap. II. Not the OrderS, but the yenerat christian retiyion ouyht

3 to be favoured, p. 52 7. Definition of the latter, p. 52 7. The asser-

3 ¹ tion domini cuiusdam, (1) that the yenerat retiyion of Christ takes
only the mandata (not the consilia) of Christ as a rute of life, is
wrony, p. 527-528,· for he who toves God with att his heart, atso
fulsits the consilia (i. e. the three known monastieal vows), p. 529.

2 Dilcewise wronq is his opinion, that private retiyions as suoh obliye
'their members to fulfil not only the mandata, but also the consilia,

. aad eventualty abso the precepta of the hoty Fathers. This is refuted
