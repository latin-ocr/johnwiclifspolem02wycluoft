ΙΙ. Summary of Contenta

Chap. I. The introduction starts from the doctrine of the C'hureh.
Aeoordinq to eatholio teaehiny the eominunity of the Eleet is divided
into three parts: the Chureh Triumphant (the blest in Heaven), the Chureh
Militant (the livino, at war with the world) and the Ghuroh Dormi-
tant (those who have fallen asleeffi i. e. the souls in puryatory), p. 653—
6²54. These three parts must be in harmony, if the Chureh is to
slourish. Henee the first condition of healthy life is unity and peace
in the -Keeelesia militans. This uniti] is yrounded on Emod. XXV
and epus JV, p. 654—655. ,

Chap. II—I V. From the unity of the ideal Churoh should spring]
that of the eonyreyation of the faithful, whieh appears endanyered by
the quatuor seete noviter introducto. This fourfold division tends
to disunion, p. 656—65 7. The various objections, praetieal‚ sophistie
and philosophieal are to be set aside, p. 658-662.

Chap. V. Haviny treated this materia abstracta, the author pro-
ceeds to an emamination, in polemieal fashion, of the praetieal eircum-
stanees of the Ghureh, as it then emisted.
