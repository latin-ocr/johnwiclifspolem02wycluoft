ΙΙΙ. Date of composition.

Without any clue. If the Tract be yenuine, some remark as to ¹ ¹¹
what public discussion in the University it refers, must be eapected to '⁶
be found in other (unpublished) writinys of W. Op. cap. I beqirminy. ’ ¹
In spite of careful research, I have been unable to find a sufficient cause ,  -
for the compilation of this Tract in W.'⁷s life, ‘espesially dim-inq his 3 ,
activity at the University. ³

IV. Genuineness.

Amonyst all the polemical writinys of W.⁷s, this is the least .
authenticated. It is not mentioned either in the Vienna Gataloyues or* “
Bale or Leland. As far as I can judye, Shirley for the first time
mentions the Tract as a qenuine work of Wiclif, Catal. No. 81
p. 27, but without qiviny any reason. He did so, probably, because-'fl'
the Tract is found in the Wiclif-Godices;² with ref. to this, compare,‘j³ ³
for instance, Shirley's aryument for the authenticity of the fragment:
De fratfibus ad scholares, Cat. No. 90: „found with worlcs of Wyclifi
and said to correspond to corre-§spond to them in style' which I decia-⁴ „

¹ and is, therefore, attributed by Denis to the pre-reformer‚ cp. II, 1459,· 11⁷1ss ’
