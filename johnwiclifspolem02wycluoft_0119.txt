are divided into two qroups (each in two), — of these G——cc (or A—fi')
aqree 78 times,· α-β (or A—C) 11 times, Ο-β (or A—a) twice.

quite irrelevant, is peculiar to C—cc: a. p. ΙΙ, 25, v. h. ΙΙΙ, 4,· i. v. e.
ΠΙ, 8,· e. e. IV, 16,· b. Β. e. IV, 24, i. r. IV, 27, p. e. l. V, 6²,-

p. a. p. VIII, 15,· e. m. d. VIII, 36, s. t. VIII, 44. The same pas-
sayes are also to be admitted as proof of the connection between the
qroups Α-β.

It follows further (1) from the very numerous omissions of
’ the somewhat careless α (I do not quote all on account of their yreat
number, but cp. for instance laudabil. VIII, 13, huma. I, 3,· vita
II, 2) that the text of C which is complete, cannot have been derived
from cc,· in the same way (2) from laudabil. VIII, 13 and I V, 30,-

VIII, 26, where a has filled up the blanks found in G, mostly in
conformity with the two other codd„ it is evident that oc cannot well
have been derived from C. The almost entire ayreement os both codd.
(even in their slips of the pen) seems to me to show that both spriny
from a common source,· cp. above under A Ι. 1 and 3.

ΙΙ. Α-β stand in a similiar connection (cp. above under A I.
2 and 3). β has many, in part lonyer, omissions: et cum ΙΙ, 11 ,·

cut VII, 40. A yives in these passayes the complete tecet, therefore

⁷ β was not the oriyinal of A. *With ref to the reverse, that A was
- not the oriyinal of β, cp. ex hoe op. VIII, 52, also quand. VIII,

14, min. penit. VII, 21, pap. (om.) VII, 1,· pene VII, 6 and many

‚ more. The reading] religionib. IV, 18 seems to me to speak for their
* having] oriqinated from the same source.

B. The best Codex. In the passayes which vary, to the
nwmber of about 195, A reads what is false 103 times, β 94 times,
α 34 times and G 28 times. Group Α-β, therefore, on account
