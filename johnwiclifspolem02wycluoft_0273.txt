DE CHRISTO ET SUO ADVERSARIO ANTIOHRISTO. 643

VII, 26 etc. (best to be compared in the codem itself),· Ε, on tlie other
hand, in spite of its own carelessness, yives the riybt word at once in
these passayes. -- (b) The trutli of our proposition is evident from the
passaye: petro in apostolatu VI, 14, for this state of tliinys hardly
admits of any other eoeplanation, than that A was lyiny before E,
and that the latter misled by petro yot into the wrong] line. On the
other hand, A could not copy from Ε, because Ε had not the com-
plete text, not even (which would seriously affect our conclusion), in
an emendation in marqin. Neitlzer can it be objected that· tlie com-
pletion may be A's conjecture, for this objection is rendered futile by
the fact that Β, Ο and D yive the sentence 'in the same words,² and
that it is a quotation from the Vulyate (Gal. II). For these reasons
'I conclude, that Ε is derived from A. Moreover, Ε copied from A,
, as Karl Muller in liis penetratiny and valuable review of my edition
in Sybels Histor. Zeitsclzrift 1881, p. 75 ff., remarks, after the oriqinal
had underyone a revision by Al. Al yives, strictly speakiny, no cor-
rections, but rather emendations, conjectures etc„ cp. dividuntur ΙΙ, 12,
patet sec. V, 8,· erat VI, 3o,· scit X, 25, in this last case the emen-
dation is justified practically, but in fact tlte readiny of the best MSS.
which by the preceding] nec—nec is rendered intelliyible to a certain extent,
is ayainst it. The only passaye which militates ayainst tlte foreyoinq
conclusion: nec IV, 10, cannot, on account of the similaritgs of the
paleoyraphical forms of nec and ut, be considered of yreat weifylit. —
Ε sprinys then from the already corrected A. For this reason, and
also because the copyist of Ε is extremely careless and inaccurate
