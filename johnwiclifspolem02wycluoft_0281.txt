DE CHRISTO ET SUO ADVERSARIO ANTIOHRISTO. 651

Of course, a number of such corrupt readinys are also to be found
in A and G, but with few eccceptions they result ltere from sliyliter mis-
takes, and are not so numerous. I have counted the lectio vera and
falsa in all the MSS. , In 298 passayes the codd. are in decided dis-
ayreement,· of these, B yives tlie wrong) reading] 92 times, C 7 4 timeS,
A 71 times (D 109 times, E 96 times). Lastly, I must ayain point
out, that B alone lias a false readiny no less than 60 times, ayainst
the consensus of the rest,· in this respect it is inferior to cod. D, which
is otherwise of little value (57 false readinys), whilst (J lias only 21,
A only 10 corruptions of the kind. Tliis is a number, affordiny
powerful enouqli proof of the neyliyence and untrustworthiness of B!
¹ If, in this respect, I have not seen my way to follow the pro-
* posals of my reviewerS, my renewed critical investiyations combined

ᾇ with the objections raised in the reviews mentioned above ayainst my
¹ appreciation of the MSS„ have at least shaken me somewliat in my opinion

> of the superiority of A over C. After having] completed the critical ewa-

.· mination of the remaining] 25 Tracts printed in this volume, I brouylit
2 to the renewed study of the one before us, a prejudice yreatly in fa·
“ vour of Ο, which I must liold to be justified, since I am led to the

belief that 13 of the Tracls in question are to be based upon G.
Nevertheless I am inclined to maintain A's candidature even ayainst

, G, because (1) out of the 298 crucial passayes A yives 227 times,
<md G only 224 timeS, the riylit readin9,· but especially because (2) A,
, as pointed out above, is alone in yiviny a wrony readiny ayainst the

consensus of the rest only 10 times, ayainst the 22 times of G. And
lastlsq, as to the intrinsic value of G’s readinys, tlte followiny as com-
pared with the corrupt readinys of A, seem to me yreatly to impair

⁷ the worth of G: < duplex I, 6,· exempl. I, 22,· si VIII, 23; humil.

Δ XI, 10,· seductas XI, 35‚· also the entire cap. X and XII (which
cp). As moreover A² has materially improoed by his emendations
the oriyinal copy of the first scribe, which cannot be said of C1 in
respect to C, I yive the palm to A. At the same time, I must not

· omit lo mention emungeret V, 30 in favour of G.

In conclusion, that all the MSS. here made use of, point to a
