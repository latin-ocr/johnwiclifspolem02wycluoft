636 INTRODUCTION ΤΟ JOHN WICLIF’S

According] to apostolic doctrine the head of the Church is Christ: Ἴ
in the face of this fact the Romish claims are in every respect un- ι’
justifiable, p. 663. They come under the four followiny heads: (1) Is ξ

 

Peter the head of the Church? (Proof from Holy Scripturej from Ι
Peter's name), p. 664-665.

Chap. VII. (2) Is Peter the Vicar of Christ, in respect of haviny ³ ⁷
a special preroqative above that of the other disciples? (scriptural and ’
historical proof), p. 665-668.

Chap. VII. (3) Has the Roman Pontifex received his power from
Peter (scriptural proof, with a reference to history [Silvester]).9

p. 669—671. —- Wiclif's protest, p. 671.
Chap. VIII—IX. The lamentable division of the Chwrch, the “

corruption of the cleryy, the worldliness of the Pope, the incompati-

bility of the papal election by the cardinals with holy Scripture — all

point to the same truth, that the Church can ewist without the Pope, ·

p. 6 71 -6 76.

Chap. Χ (4) Is the Pope (in questions of ethics and doctrine)
infallible? ·—- This, as well as the three first question-9, is to be ans-
wered in the neyative, p. 6 7 7-6 7 9. -

Chap. ΧΙ. The Pope stands rather in a position of to— Ῑ
tal antagonisni to Christ: if this thesis can be proved, he is Anti-
christ. The proposition is then demonstrated in twelve cases: ⁴

(1) Christ the truth — the Pope the principle of false- ²
hood and lies (in words, writinys, works), p. 680. ,

(2) Christ's poverty — the Pope's wordly maynificence. ψ

(3) Christ's ineekness and humility ·—- the Pope's pride ι
and cruelty (Crusade), p. 681 -682, ,

(4) Christ’s law perfect and sufficient — the Pope’s
new cruel law and his oppression of the faithful, v
p. 682-683.

Chap. XII. (5) Christ's missionary zeal and eoehortation to missio-
nary work — the Pope and his followers either en-
throned in yoryeous palaces, or shut up in mona-
steries‚ p. 683-685,

Chap. ΧΙΙΙ. (6) Christ’s contempt for secular power — the Pope’s ⁷
claim of dominion over all earthly kinydoms, p. 686.
