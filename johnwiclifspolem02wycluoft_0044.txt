414 INTRODUOTION To JOHN WIOLIF’S

p. 421. From suehlihe oppression the ruin of the land is not far ’
off. Remedy ayainst this, p. 422. '
Chap. III. If they thus continue to oppress the poor, they sin .'
also ayainst the Holy Spirit, because they offend ayainst His 'very na- [Γ
ture, ayainst yoodness and eharity, p. 423—423. For all the spiritual 2
yifts which are handed to the people by the hands of the eleryy, as “
indulqenees ancl suehlike, are yenerally aeeessible only to rioh men, be-' ³
cause they ean be aequirecl only by money, p. 424. Thus the poor
must live without the divine yifts of yraee, p. 424. And this sin is
to be considered a heavy one,· the more so, as the prelates clo what

is in their miyht to prevent faithful priests from the preaehiny of
the simple Gospel of Goel, p. 425.

III. Date of Composition.

To juclqe from the whole tone of the Traet, it ‘must have been'
written shortly after the death of the Blaoh Prinoe, who died on the
Feast of the Holy Trinity, June 8, 1377, op. Ohron. Anyl. ed. M ⁵
Thonipson, 88. The style also, I believe, suits this date well ,· the del‘ ι ⁴
berate tranquillity of the Author’s later times seems to be wanting] in it. —

I would defend this date more heenly, unless in the last chapter t
opposition between the rieh eleryy, who try to hinder the free preaehi ε
of the Gospel by the itinerant preaehers (sacerdos fidens, volens gra ⁰ ᾗ
predicare ewangelium Iesu Oristi erit slatim prohibitus predicar
ep. p. 424) were so sharply marked ,· for aoeordinq to all particula ⁸
hitherto known of the institute of W.⁷ s itinerari) preaeherS, an earl‘a' .
date than thei Jear 1382 woulcl not suit this antayonism. The da ὲ,
must, therefore, remain uncertain.
