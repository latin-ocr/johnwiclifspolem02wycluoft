444 INTROD UOTION To JOHN WJOLJPS,

the same tinec proclaiminy that every Christian has not only the riyht, ¹

but that it becomes hisduty, to slay his brother, p. 45 9. This is entirely

contrary to the ScriptureS, to Moses, Paul or Christ: therefore away η

with the Four Orders! p. 460—463. λ
Chap. IV. For, tauyht by the father of lies, they proclaim lies

by assertiny (and falsely quotiny the O. Τ. as their authority) that ’

the present conflict between the two Popes takes place with God' s ap-

probation ,· whereas all' schism. is ayainst His laws, p. 463—46’5. -2
Therefore once ayain, both, Popes and their chief supporters, the -

Friars, should be done away with p. 466—46‘7. ’ , ,
Chap. V. When examininy more closely the principles of the

‘FriarQ it is apparent that Christian virtue rests with them in outward Ι

This, besides being] injurious to themselves, does harm to the Church, 3
p. 474—476'. It would, therefore, be the duty of their superiors to · ’

join Christ's side, and thus put an end to all smaller private Sects‚ ³ ¹
p. 476—4 78. - Even if such advice should be considered heretical, j

and the adviser be followed by threats and persecutions, it should inti—

midate no one freni leaviny their community, as it would deliver the ἱ

Church from a yreat burden, p. 478-482.
ΙΙΙ. Date of Compositeon.

It appears from chap. ΙΙ and ΙΙΙ that the Schism and the war · J
between the two Popes, consequent upon it, was the occasion of this· ᾖ ”
Tract. The former is to be directly inferred froon several passaye8: ³ ⁵
