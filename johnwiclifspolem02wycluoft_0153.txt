VII. The Manasscripts.

1 Only after haviny formed my text on the basis of cod. a, Ι had
ἒ access in Vienna for a short time to the codices G and D, which Ι then
{ ..collated Ι was thus not able to undertake a critical examination of
³ ¹all three codices, and have printed the present text on the basis of
³ all three Manuscripts, without yiviny preference to any.
ξ Ι believe, however, to judqe from a cursory ylance, that G and
-Ι are in some way related to each otber,· with ref. to this, op. besides

’π ι ctionem, consolationem etc.). — Ο has been corrected by two hands.
’ψ D there are tlte corrections, or additions of three hands to be no-
,· here the text is in a tarye deyree adorned with red commas.

¹ What I bave said with ref. to this point above (see De Rel. Priv. I
.. 486 ff.) ayaimst the genuineness of the latter Prae-t, may be, in general, adduce d
{J favour of the present Treatise. I arm rather isael ined to suppose that from tlte
