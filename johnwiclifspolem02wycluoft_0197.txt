DE DISSENSIONE PAPAE ΠΜ.

’ Shirley’s hypothesis, that the followiny Tract is a letter addressed
to Bishop Spenser of Norwick, is based, I believe, on the Emplicit
of cod. G,· the shortness of the Tract may also have influenced Shirleqj
in liis supposition. —- I am not of liis opinion. For such externat
'perfidencffl as yiven in cod. G, is very often of merely relative or no
velue at all; ep. in this respect the tradition referring) to VViclif's so-called
Later of Eoecuse addressed to Pope Urban VI„ Lecliler, Ι, 713 ff. —-
On the other hand, it is to be observed, that none of the characters of a
Ietta, such as allomtion and epistolary conclusion are to be found here, ·
whereas the Tract, following] in oc, from its ver J beyinninq rn'anifests
itself as a real letter. Tltirdly, no personal reference to tlte bisliop,
eitlter in the second or third person is made. —— If ive further coin-
poere this present Pract with its Enylish parallel version, which con-
tains no less than 8 chapters, it becomes evident that a work of this
lenyffi cannot be taken as a letter. And tlte niaryinal yloss at tlte end
of οων Tract: hic non est fim's shows that it is, in its present state
only a fraqment.

On tlae contrary, if we compare this fraqm-ent with tlte first
chapter of the Gruciata, it appears that the Tract containing] in a
precise form the Author’s yravest objections aqainst the Papal Schisrn
must be looked upon as a pamphlet‚ intended to arouse an aqitation
- aanonyst the cultivated classes of Enyland ayainst the Pope. Tlie
Enylish version (Arnold, SE. W. HI, 242 ff.) was apparently written
for circulation amony the people who did not understand Latin.

² Shirley, Catal. calle also No. 61, 4 a letter; but Lechler lias already
down, J. v. JV, Ι, 713 Note ‘2 that it is not.
