. DE CITATJONIBUS FRIVOLIS. 545

Resides this near ayreernent compare the omissione common to both
culpa etc. Ι, 9 and also manifeste etc. VI, ⁴19. Nevertheless the two

, codd. do not appear to have been derived immediately the one from
’ the other.

B. The best Codeoe. In 14o passayes the codd. differ decisi-
’θρίω Ε qives a false readiny 83 times, α 39, G 36 and A 32 times.
Ε is, therefore, to be excluded‚ althouyh it has some excellent readinys
ayainst the (wrony) ayreement of the remaininy codd„ see hoe exig. Ι, 9,·
obiurg. v. c. Ι, 53,· dee. et ant. ΙΙΙ, 22,· especially ad in VH, 2,· ad
VII, 22,· cel. VII, 23 and currerent VIII, 13. Froni thern it is evident,
tliat the oriyinal of A and Ε, was a yood one, and that the scribe of Ε
merely by his own carelessness and defects is not trustwortly. α also,
with 25 readings of its own, has been copied in a careless manner: in
15 instances the wrony readinys are yiven (cp. rep. Ι, 45, solute Ι, 58,-

irrekvant, the only' yood one beiny execrata ΙΙΙ, 2 which in Ash is also
yiven. On this account, οι does not enter into competition. The rea-
dinys of cod. Ashburnham, which throuyh the hindness of F. D. Matthew,
Esq„ London, became accessible to nie only when the printer had nearly

finished his work, 'could not be taken into account for the critical exami-
nation of the Mss. But I will not foryet to add that Ash stands nearest

' to cod. Ε, ep. ohap. Ι note 47,· 53; ΙΙ, 12,· ΙΙΙ, 39,· 4o,· 41,· 43,-

V, 4,· VI, 4,· VH, 9,· 22,· 23 ,· VIII, 13; IX, 16. At any rate, Ash
is inferior in yoodness to codd. Ο and A. Thus these two only re-
main. Which is the better is doubtful. Ι have counted out the pas·
sayes in which both read the wrong] ayainst the consensus of the other ,·
lmt this also is of no consequence, both reading] the wrong] in 11 in-
stances; A has once the correct reading] ayainst the ayreernent of the
rest, C in no case. Leaviny therefore this critical question unanswered,

Ι yive the following] text according] to both; in doubtful cases G is
relied upon.
