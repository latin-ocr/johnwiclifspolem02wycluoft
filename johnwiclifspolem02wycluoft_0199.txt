VI. The Manuserrtpts.

A. Their relationskip. Atthonyh the eritieal material is
very small, the yroup A—E, as in former easeS, here also may be
discerned; nearly all the readinys differiny from O and a are eom-
mon to both, their own variations consisting in small yraphieal errors.
Readinys, characteristic for their mutual relation, are ad generalem
note 7; gracie nisi 12; ecelesiam 24, sunt 33, est 36, eum 41,-
de (om.) 46, ergo 9,· 23, 29. Τ he material is too stender to show,
whether E has been eopied from A or from· another eodem of the
smne line.

G—cc also mre related to one another; see their Emplieit (ep. epi-
stola ad episc. N.) colleeeio 39.

Β. The best Codex. E, here ayain, has been eopied in an
utterly cameless manner. A and Ο appear of the same valae 2,· the best
is, I suppose α, whose readinys nearly in every ease yive the eorreet

’ text; where this is not the ease, its readinys are, at least, possible.

I will take, therefore, α as tlte basis of my teoet.

² Perhaps Ο is the better of the ὑωο, ep. monstrosa note 4 ‚· gracie nisi 12,-
Ooclesiam 243 sunt 33,- sic 38.
