Neither does its corrector Β] contribute anythiny of immam,- ἐπ ’ =

17 cases out of 19 it ayrees with A xancl C—D, and must therefore ⁷

have been yuided either by one of these three MSS. or by an oriyiml ’

older than the three. The numbers just yiven would even seem to show ἶ
the inferiority of B to G—D. But this badness appears in a sornewhat
different liyht, and its superiority to this yroup will be evident, so soon ι

as passiny over its lectio vera where it is independent, we take accozmt ’ “
of the latter, wherever it belonys at the same time to one‘ or the other 2 ν

of the codd. and then proceed to compare it with that of G—D.
Amonyst about 420 crueial readinys, D has 109, G 224, and Β 206
correctiones. If, besides these numbers, Ι consider the intrinsic valae ss
of the readinys, I should· be inclined to place cod. Β at least before· -s
cod. D,· cod. G, 1 believe, is superior to Β. ·1

IV. God. δ. - The small eompass of the accessible parallel
teoet prevents our takiny an estimate of the codem which may be in
any deyree certain. I must confine myself to yeneral statements. On
the whole the copyist has not done his work badly ,⁰ of about 120 of ⁷
the readinys in question, δ has 84 belonyiny to the lectio vera, 30 to ’

the lectio salsa,· in no case does it offer the correct reading] ayainst ’

the consensus of the 5 others.2 There are but few faults of oversiyht. J
I incline to the opinion, that it does not belony to the family Α-Ε, ⁷ ·
especially as it does not contain the ejaculation in Ozeeh XII, 38, ζ
which would not have escaped the Bohernian copyist. Whether it is
related to c—D, or to Β, Ι do not venture to decide, owiny to want -
of the requisite datas?

readinys belony to the lectio vera (or 6, see above under 3. a. ), 64 to the lectio ·’

falsa. These last, as a close comparison will show, are yenerally due to emlm- ’”

ness in the copyist (for the most part slips of the pen).
