But it can be proved that Ε and F have not beeri copied one from , ἓ

Ι believe, they had an old common oriqinal, which miyht reach bach
behind their second or third deyree (cp. facit incl. ΙΙ, 43). In this ’
case E, which first had been copied badly, was corrected by E'2, who
had neither O, rior y (ad contr. recip.· ΙΙΙ, 16) as his oriqinal. Ἴ Fhas ⁸
not beeri copied from this corrected Ε (armet ΙΙΙ, 21, ad ΙΙ, 18 ,· ¹ ·

(2) Whether G and γ are of the same hin, Ι do not venture to

B. The best Codeoe. From the precediny it is clear that the
best MS. does root belomy to Ctass E-F, Ε especially is iri a state of
yreat corruption; irc the 85 decisive passayeS, Ε reads 50 times, F 30
times, γ 19 times, G 13 times wrorty. In decidiny, whether O or Ἴ
y be the better, I have found the readinys (leven. ΙΙΙ, 40 and quas
min. ΙΙ, 37, 38 in favour of C'.2 Ι take, therefore, G as the basis =
of 'my text.
